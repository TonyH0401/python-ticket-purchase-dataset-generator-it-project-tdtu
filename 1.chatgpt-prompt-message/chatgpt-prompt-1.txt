As an expert in creating datasets with Python, please create a CSV file with at least 1 million row entries. If there are limits in python on Row amount, duplicate the code within the code to get the results I want.

The dataset should contain sales data for an online ticket selling marketplace/website.

The date range of the data should be spread over January 2021 to December 2023 and should be chosen at random.
There should be at least 1000000 random CustomerNames. 
CustomerName repeated less than 10 times in a month. 
CustomerName cannot repeated twice for the same EventName in the same date.
Each CustomerName is mapped to 1 CustomerID only. Each EventName is mapped to 1 EventID only.
At least 200 different EventName.
The TicketQuantyPerEvent must be randomly generated with a range from 1 to 15 per CustomerName.
PaymentType must be between Cash or Transaction.

Please add the following columns and their format:
CustomerName, Text
CustomerID, Text
SaleDate, Date dd/mm/yyyy
EventName, Text
EventID, Text
TicketQuantyPerEvent, Number
TotalPrice, Currency
PaymentType, Text

Please create fake random names for CustomerName and EventName

The CSV should then be export here
